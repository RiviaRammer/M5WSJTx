# CardFTx on Cardputer Adv

This sketch adapts `ft8_lib` to an ESP32-S3 Arduino project using the ES8311 codec.

## Pins

| ES8311 | ESP32-S3 GPIO |
| --- | --- |
| SDA | G8 |
| SCL | G9 |
| SCLK / BCLK | G41 |
| ASDOUT / ADC data | G46 |
| LRCK / WS | G43 |
| DSDIN / DAC data | G42 |

## Build Notes

- Select an ESP32-S3 board profile in Arduino IDE.
- If boot prints `quad_psram: PSRAM chip is not connected, or wrong PSRAM`, set PSRAM to Disabled or try the board package's exact Cardputer Adv PSRAM option. The sketch now falls back to internal RAM when PSRAM is unavailable.
- Use a large app partition if the default sketch partition is tight.
- The decode task uses a 16 KB stack. Large FFT buffers are allocated on heap/PSRAM instead of the task stack.
- Copy `src/config_example.h` to `src/config.h` for local Wi-Fi credentials and private settings. Keep `src/config.h` out of git.

## Commands

Open Serial Monitor at `115200`, or type the same commands on the Cardputer keyboard. The bottom line of the screen shows the current keyboard command; press Enter to run it.

- `set SSID your_wifi_name` sets the Wi-Fi SSID.
- `set PASS your_wifi_password` sets the Wi-Fi password.
- `sync` connects Wi-Fi with the current SSID/PASS and runs NTP sync.
- `mode` toggles between FT8 and FT4. Switching mode aborts any current RX/TX work before the radio task restarts in the new mode.
- `set msg CQ TEST AB12` edits the stored FTx message and validates it locally.
- `set freq 1000` sets the FTx base audio tone in Hz.
- `tx` queues the stored message for the next UTC FT8/FT4 boundary. After TX, the radio task returns to continuous RX.
- `esc`, `cancel`, or `stop` cancels queued TX or stops the current TX.
- `rx` or `rx once` is retained as a harmless status command; continuous RX is already running by default.
- `home` shows the live dashboard.
- `history` shows recent decoded messages.
- `waterfall` or `wf` shows the live RX waterfall during capture.
- On the Cardputer keyboard, `/` cycles through home, history, and waterfall. `Fn+M` toggles FT8/FT4. ESC cancels queued/current TX.
- `show` prints the stored message, frequency, Wi-Fi state, and UTC sync state.
- `help` prints the command list.

The receiver starts automatically after boot once UTC time is synced. It captures an FT8 or FT4 window at 12 kHz with `M5Cardputer.Mic` and prints decoded candidates:

```text
FT8 +12.5 dB +0.80 s 1000 Hz ~ CQ TEST AB12
```

## Current Scope

The TX path uses `M5Cardputer.Speaker` and schedules playback on UTC 00/15/30/45 second boundaries after NTP sync. RX uses `M5Cardputer.Mic`, so speaker playback and microphone capture are switched rather than used simultaneously.

## Runtime Design

CardFTx now treats RX as the default operating mode. Single-shot RX/TX commands are avoided in the main UI path: the radio task continuously waits for the next FT8 or FT4 slot, captures RX audio, decodes, and loops. The `tx` command only marks the current stored message as pending for the next slot; the radio task performs the scheduled TX and then goes back to RX.

The task split is intentionally simple:

- Arduino `loop()` remains on the UI side. It calls `M5Cardputer.update()`, reads the keyboard/serial command line, and redraws the screen once per second.
- `ft8Radio` is pinned to core 0. It owns microphone capture, FT8/FT4 decode, scheduled speaker TX, and audio device switching.
- Shared state is copied through a small critical section. The radio task only draws directly while the waterfall view is visible during RX capture.

## Screen Design

The home screen is a compact dashboard rather than a full waterfall:

```text
FT8                         RX
UTC 12:34:08 Odd 07s
RX -> Decode

TX 1000Hz ready
CQ BG6WRI ON80
RX new 2 total 5 AF 1830/214
>command
```

- The top-left protocol label is `FT8` or `FT4`; use `Fn+M` or the `mode` command to switch.
- The top-right mode is `RX` in green or `TX` in red.
- The second line shows UTC, current slot parity, and countdown to the next protocol boundary.
- The third line shows the current action and predicted next action.
- The TX area shows the stored outgoing message and whether it is queued.
- The RX area only says whether new messages arrived. Detailed decoded text stays off the home screen.

Press `/` to cycle Home -> History -> Waterfall. The history screen shows the newest decoded lines first with audio frequency, estimated SNR, and a shortened message. Opening history clears the unread count. The waterfall screen draws the live RX waterfall while a capture is in progress and otherwise shows a waiting/status panel.
